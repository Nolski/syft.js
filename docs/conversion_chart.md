# Syft.js Tensorflow & PyTorch API Support

We are still currently working on support for a number of API endpoints within
both PyTorch and Tensorflow. Below you can find a brief outline of which API
endpoints are supported.

| Tensorflow API | PyTorch API | Tensorflow.js API | Supported |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| abs            | abs         | abs               | X         |
